# Robust Speech Recognition System Against the Effects of Noise
Robust Speech Recognition System Against the Effects of Noise is a system that is used to recognize word statements from a speaker. Generally, Robust Speech Recognition System Against the Effects of Noise is divided into two components, the first are training component and the second are recognizing component. Training component contents with process to do training of speaker word statements, with several parameters as an input. Basically, training component will influence the recognition results, depending on the rules and the input data that are being used. There are two processes in recognizing component, the first are a process to recognize speaker word statements, and the second are detection process. Recognizing process can be done after training process because basicly, recognizing is done to search for the similarity of training result. The detecting process is done to detect signal which being a focus as an effect of noise, which hopefully will make a better signal recognition. This thesis analyze and evaluate several methods of detection(Energy,Periodicity, MLR and Energy+MLR) with detection parameters to know the accuracy of detection result toward several noise effect. Energy+ MLR method is the best method from detection methods.
